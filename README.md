# Human_Activity_Recognition

Objective: Human Activity Recognition through Support Vector Machine by performing multi-class classification. 
Also you need to perform  the following Things:-                                         
1.scikit learn for incorporating various kernels to perform multi-class classification. 
2. Compare the performance of these kernels through Confusion matrix.
3.  3. Print the value of parameters of the SVM algorithm.
